/**
 * Single source of truth for "where does user data live?".
 *
 * Resolution priority:
 *   1. SEO_DATA_DIR env var — explicit override (Docker uses /data)
 *   2. dirname(SEO_DB_PATH) — if the user set the DB path, data lives next to it
 *   3. process.cwd() — native install default (the install folder itself)
 *
 * This means a native install keeps everything in one folder (the install
 * directory). A Docker install keeps everything on the mounted volume.
 * Either way, "back up the data folder" is a complete backup.
 *
 * Files that live here:
 *   - data.db (+ data.db-wal, data.db-shm)
 *   - .seo-encryption-key (AES key for API keys / OAuth tokens)
 *   - .seo-port (last-bound port)
 *   - screenshots/ (SERP screenshots from rank checks)
